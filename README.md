# Autoworkz - Automated Networking 

Automatically configure the networks. By the end of the project, you will understand the basics of software-defined networking.


## What we're doing:

1. Writing an example mock docker container
   1. We manage the networking and resources for a mock docker container.
   2. Finished networking.
2. Declarative configuration
   1. Install pieces of software dynamically.
   2. Define a network
   3. Make changes to the network using automations.
3. Creating APIs for the network.
4. Creating command line tools to do exactly what's necessary.

## What I'm going to look for:

I will be looking for something during this project. I will primarily look for:

1. Understanding of operating systems and networking (from the mocker container project).
2. Code written as proof of understanding.
3. Interact with different networking devices (using our project)
